Introducing the completely new Industrial Craft 2 Charging Bench!

This mod adds a Charging Bench to Industrial Craft 2 which allows you to charge up to 12
items simultaneously! The Charging Bench comes in three tiers with each tier capable of
charging all items at its tier level and below, but not above. If you want to charge your
Quantum armor you'll need to craft a HV version. :)


Introducing the three tiers of Charging Bench available!
-------------------
Due to advances in over-current circuit protection designs, the Charging Bench will not
explode if exposed to higher than acceptable current but simply pop off onto the ground in a
safe manner.

LV Charging Bench
- The LV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 32 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 40,000 EU.

MV Charging Bench
- The MV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 128 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 600,000 EU.

HV Charging Bench
- The HV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 512 EU/t, and a base energy storage
  of 10,000,000 EU.

All three charging benches will automatically place valid electrical items shift-clicked into
them into the charging area if there is space free. Excess will be placed into the input slot.
Once an item is done charging, it will be automatically moved to the output slot, if there is
space, and another item from the input slot will be added to the main charging inventory.

In this way, you can shift-click a full stack of RE-Batteries into the Charging Bench, it will
automatically unstack them, charge them and you can quickly collect all of them by rapidly
shift-clicking on the output slot!


Available upgrades!
-------------------
All three tiers of the Charging Bench accept the standard array of upgrades, with each having
a very specific effect.

- The transformer upgrade will allow the lower tier benches to accept higher input energy,
  including energy crystals, lappacks, and lapotrons in the power input slot.

- The energy storage upgrade will increase the maximum energy storage of the device by 10%
  of the base amount per upgrade. This will allow each energy storage upgrade to have the same
  relative effect on each tier without making them overpowered or underpowered on any one tier.

- The overclock upgrade is where the Charging Bench will really shine. By using quantum
  tunneling technology, the Charging Bench is able to carefully manage the voltage and current
  levels used to charge items and allow items to exceed their normally safe charge rates. Each
  upgrade increases both the charge rate exponentially by 30% per overclocker, and the
  resulting energy drain exponentially by 50% per overclocker. Yes, you waste power, but
  that's the price you pay whenever you use overclockers.


There's more!!
-------------------
The Charging Benches Input, Output and Power slots are exposed to pipes/tubes! Input is on
top, output is on bottom and the power slot is from any side. While the GUI restricts items
placed into each of the slots to appropriate types there is no such restriction for pipe/tube
access. It is up to the player to design their systems so that the wrong types of items don't
get tossed onto the bench. But not to worry, there are no negative consequences to inserting
incorrect items, aside from temporarily clogging up the slot; the bench simply will not do
anything with items that it can't process.

Valid electrical items placed into the charging bench via tubes will automatically be moved
from the input slot to an available charging slot, then moved to the output slot once fully
charged. In this way, you can easily automate recharging of items!


Emitters? Wha?
-------------------
Originally created for testing purposes, we have added these Emitter blocks to the creative
inventory as a bonus for people playing in creative mode or wanting to test electrical builds
without having to constantly spawn lapotron crystals and MFSUs. 

There are four versions available.

LV Emitter
-  Emits LV current (32 EU/t) when powered by redstone

MV Emitter
-  Emits MV current (128 EU/t) when powered by redstone

HV Emitter
-  Emits HV current (512 EU/t) when powered by redstone

EV Emitter
-  Emits EV current (2048 EU/t) when powered by redstone
