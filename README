Introducing the completely new version of the IC2 Charging Bench!
(http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=929)

This mod adds a Charging Bench to IC2. The Charging Bench allows you to
charge up to 9 items simultaneously! The Charging Bench comes in three tiers
with each tier capable of charging all items at its tier level and below, but
not above. If you want to charge your Quantum armor you'll need to craft a HV
version. :)

Introducing the three tiers of Charging Bench available!
-------------------
Due to advances in over-current circuit protection designs, the Charging Bench
will not explode if exposed to higher than acceptable current but simply pop
off onto the ground in a safe manner.

LV Charging Bench
- The LV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 32 EU/t, a maximum base
  energy storage of 40,000 EU and a base charge rate of 32 EU/t.

MV Charging Bench
- The MV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 128 EU/t, a maximum base
  energy storage of 600,000 EU and a base charge rate of 128 EU/t.

HV Charging Bench
- The HV Charging Bench has a maximum input energy of 512 EU/t, a maximum base
  energy storage of 10,000,000 EU and a base charge rate of 512 EU/t.


Available upgrades!
-------------------
All three tiers of the Charging Bench accept the standard array of upgrades, with each
having a very specific effect.

- The transformer upgrade will allow the lower tier benches to accept higher input energy,
  but not do anything else.
  
- The energy storage upgrade will increase the maximum base energy storage of the device by
  a percentage of the base. This will allow each energy storage upgrade to have the same
  relative effect on each tier without making them overpowered or underpowered on any one
  tier.
  
- The overclock upgrade is where the Charging Bench will really shine. By using quantum
  tunneling technology, the Charging Bench is able to carefully manage the voltage and current
  levels used to charge items and allow items to exceed their normally safe charge rates. With
  enough overclock upgrades, a fully charged HV bench will be able to completely charge 2 1/2
  Quantum Armor suits in less than 5 seconds!

  
There's more!!
-------------------
There's a couple of new features coming that I think are going to impress and excite and
really move this mod to the next level, but I'm keeping them secret for now!
